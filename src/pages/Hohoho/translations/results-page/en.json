  "intro-h2": "Final thoughts from my time as Santa’s assistant",
  "intro-p1": "Conceiving, creating, and bringing this project to life has been an incredible journey. What started as a simple idea—how to create a snow animation—grew into something far beyond what I initially imagined.",
  "intro-p2": "To my amazement, this project didn’t just stay local—it spread far and wide, reaching people all over the world. At first, I was worried about what proportions this project might take. Social media can turn anything into a whirlwind, and I feared it could spiral into something beyond my control.",
  "intro-p3": "But to my relief, it primarily connected with people close to me—friends, friends of friends, acquaintances, and even 'strangers' who are, in some way, tied to my network. This has made the journey feel deeply personal, even as it expanded beyond my immediate circle.",
  "intro-p4": "A special thanks to my friend Laura Delgado, who shared this project with her network of small businesses in Denver, Colorado. Your support brought in so many wonderful opportunities. Thank you, Lau!",
  "intro-p5": "I carefully reviewed all the applications that were submitted, and I made sure to reply to everyone who participated. Unfortunately, some applications with great potential for being granted a website were left incomplete, which made it impossible to consider them fully. To those who missed out, I hope there will be other opportunities in the future!",
  "intro-p6": "When I was 19 and started theater school, I realized I couldn’t change \"the world\" with my work. Over time, I learned I could change my own world and help those around me. Staying true to this has been my guiding principle, and I’m proud to keep living by it. The \"Ho! Ho! Ho!\" project embodies this philosophy in a way I’m proud of.",
  "intro-p7": "The impact has been truly rewarding, and I’m excited to present some results. On this page, you’ll find the winning proposal and the statistics that came from this experience.",
  "intro-p8": "Thank you, Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year!",

  "awardee-h3-1": "About the Company",
  "awardee-p1": "The Teatro del Embuste is a Colombian artistic collective focused on performing arts, with a decade of experience and an equal number of productions. The company works on the boundary between reality and representation, and also serves as a public space offering permanent artistic programming.",
  "awardee-p2": "We had a website for the company years ago, but it was eventually closed due to minimal use. The idea of reopening a new one is motivated by the need to better inform the public about the programming of the venue.",
  "awardee-h3-2": "Purposes of the Website",
  "awardee-p3": "1. To inform about the venue’s programming, allowing users to purchase tickets",
  "awardee-p4": "2. To showcase past and future projects of the company.",
  "awardee-h3-3": "Desired Features",
  "awardee-p5": "I would like the website to be welcoming, with a high visual impact on entry. It should be clear and very user-friendly. Visitors should be immediately attracted and easily find what they are looking for in an organic and simple way. The main goal is for visitors to be drawn to the current shows and easily buy tickets. Secondly, if they wish, they should be able to explore the company’s history and projects. Additionally, we aim to offer the space for short-term rentals.",
  "awardee-h3-4": "Resources Available",
  "awardee-p6": "We have a logo, graphic package, photos, and a portfolio of the company, show by show. For the venue, we will provide photos, trailers, reviews, synopses, and technical sheets of upcoming productions.",
  "awardee-h3-5": "Technical Requirements ",
  "awardee-p7": "The website requires a very simple and self-manageable update system, with pre-configured templates. About once a month, the information about scheduled shows and events needs to be updated. It is very important that the website looks aesthetically pleasing and invites an artistic experience.",
