  "intro-p2": "I’m Danilo, a junior fullstack developer. I’ve spent the last three years studying programming. Even though I’m a beginner, I have enough knowledge, experience, and (I think) good taste to create beautiful pages.",
  "intro-p3": "My last few months have been intense, filled with job seeking, studying, and also working on some personal projects. It seems the upcoming months will also be full of activity. At this moment, however, it makes sense to me to use part of my time and knowledge for someone who might need it. Could there be a more fitting occasion than Christmas to give away a website?",
  "intro-p4": "To participate in the selection, all you need to do is submit a application. Applications will be received through a form available on the next page — read until the end to get there. Over the coming weeks, I will read each application that is sent. Anyone — person, project, organization, business, etc. — can participate by submitting a application. If you know someone who could benefit from a website, please share this page with them!",
